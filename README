Based off of https://github.com/krevis/MIDIApps

Installation
-------------------
1)Install snoize MIDI Monitor: http://www.snoize.com/MIDIMonitor/
  -The SnoizeMIDI Framework is all that is needed from this package to build MidiEventTracer
  -MIDI Monitor runs, you can save voice event traces in the MIDI Monitor format
2)Get the source code from here by cloning this project https://github.com/krevis/MIDIApps
  -$git clone https://github.com/krevis/MIDIApps.git
3)Manually adjust paths in the Makefile to point it to the framework path 
  and the headers in the cloned repo
4)make
5)There should be a binary called "unarch".


Using
----------
1)Save a MIDI file in MIDI Monitor (blah.mMon)
2)Run unarch on blah.mMon


Options
------------
Usage: unarch <mMon file> [mode = t|f]

mode is options.  When mode is 't', MidiEventTracer will print tone names (like
C#3).  When mode is 'f', MidiEventTracer will print tone frequencies (like
166.345980).


Miscellaneous
---------------
generate_chango_tuning.pl generates a file that contains 25 tones.  It works by
removing octave identifiers, then extrapolating from the existing tones to
populate a list of 25 tones, spanning 5 octaves (at most) when that is
possible.
